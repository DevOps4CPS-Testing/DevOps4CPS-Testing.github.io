                        Much of the increasing complexity of ICT systems is being driven by the more distributed and heterogeneous nature of these systems, with Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) accounting for an increasing portion of Software Ecosystems. Blending best practices DevOps solutions with the development processes used in the CPS to deliver software more rapidly and result in a more secure manner are emerging and critical open challenges of both contemporary and future CPS development. The core part of required solutions needs more advanced test automation and deployment strategies, which work efficiently and in an adaptive manner in different CPS domains, while addressing different CPS technical requirements. However, research in the field is in early stage for what concerns DevOps automation for CPSs, and simply running test cases in DevOps pipelines is still limited. Now testing and deployment automation needs to rise to the next level by going beyond mere test execution of “software systems”, for which Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) activities are not required as with CPS. Moreover, while software engineers, artificial intelligence (AI) engineers and data scientists are actively working on such issues, very few work have been done to address the most emerging challenges involving CPS, which requires the expertise of all these experts.

	  <br> 1400 to 1415: Welcome and Introduction (Chair: Shaukat Ali) </br>
	  <br> <b> Keynote 1:</b> (Chair: Shaukat Ali)</br>
	  <br> <b>1415 to 1515: Software Engineering for Quantum Computing and Quantum Computing for Software Engineering by <a href= "https://sites.google.com/view/marcopistoia/"> Marco Pistoia </a> (JPMorgan Chase & Co.) </b> <a href="https://youtu.be/64S3-dmYdQo">, Video </a></br>	
<br> <b> Abstract: </b> Leveraging qubit superposition and entanglement, Quantum Computing is paving the way for extremely efficient computations.  The underlying quantum hardware is not yet capable of solving industrial-scale problems, but while quantum hardware providers are working at a very fast pace to achieve quantum advantage, the entire software engineering community is making incredible progress in building a new software stack for Quantum Computing, which, from the highest entry-point level down to the execution on quantum hardware, includes the cloud-based access layer, the applications layer, the algorithms layer, and the circuit compilation and optimization layer.  This is an important time in the development of Quantum Computing because software engineers have the unique opportunity to shape the software stack by devising new quantum-specific programming languages, novel software principles, and hardware-independent circuit compilers and optimizers to give researchers the opportunity to move from one hardware provider to another with the highest level of flexibility.  In this keynote, I will present an overview of the state of the art of Software Engineering for Quantum Computing.  I will also address another topic, which is often overlooked: the reverse need for Quantum Computing to facilitate Software Engineering by addressing hard problems that developers have to face on a daily basis, such as reducing the complexity of static program analysis and using Quantum Computing for Machine Learning to reduce the number of the false positives resulting from static analysis.</br>

<br> <b>1400 to 1500: From qubits to Quantum Accelerator - The Full Stack Vision by <a href="CV.pdf"> Koen Bertels </a> (University of Porto, Portugal) </b> <a href="https://youtu.be/-Or8f8VUr88">, Video </a></br>	
	  <br><b> Abstract: </b> Quantum computing is a very popular topic even though we still have quite some distance to travel before anything useful will be available. However, there is a lot of work that can be done by other scientific and even industrial fields. The main important topics to work on are all focused on developing a prototype of a quantum accelerator that can be connected to a normal computer and execute the quantum gates. We have been working on the full stack of a quantum computer but given the state and lack of quality of the quantum bits, called qubits, we think it is much more interesting to focus on the development of quantum algorithms that execute functionality that is important for the scientific or commercial partners. This talk will therefore explain the full stack and also illustrate what is already available in the public domain to help others start developing applications and even test the micro-architecture and a powerful quantum simulator that will be needed to execute the algorithm.Given the context of the conference, I will give examples with respect to the software and programming aspects.</br>
